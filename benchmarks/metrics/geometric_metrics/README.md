- abstract: Bayesian optimization is a principled optimization strategy
    for a black-box objective function. It shows its effectiveness in a
    wide variety of real-world applications such as scientific discovery
    and experimental design. In general, the performance of Bayesian
    optimization is reported through regret-based metrics such as
    instantaneous, simple, and cumulative regrets. These metrics only
    rely on function evaluations, so that they do not consider geometric
    relationships between query points and global solutions, or query
    points themselves. Notably, they cannot discriminate if multiple
    global solutions are successfully found. Moreover, they do not
    evaluate Bayesian optimization's abilities to exploit and explore a
    search space given. To tackle these issues, we propose four new
    geometric metrics, i.e., precision, recall, average degree, and
    average distance. These metrics allow us to compare Bayesian
    optimization algorithms considering the geometry of both query
    points and global optima, or query points. However, they are
    accompanied by an extra parameter, which needs to be carefully
    determined. We therefore devise the parameter-free forms of the
    respective metrics by integrating out the additional parameter.
    Finally, we empirically validate that our proposed metrics can
    provide more delicate interpretation of Bayesian optimization
    algorithms, on top of assessment via the conventional metrics.
